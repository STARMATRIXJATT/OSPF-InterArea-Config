🚀 OSPF Inter-Area Communication: Configuring Multi-Area Routing 🌍

In network design, dividing a large OSPF network into multiple areas improves scalability and efficiency. I recently worked on setting up inter-area communication using OSPF, ensuring seamless data flow between different network segments.

Key Highlights of My Configuration:
✅ Area 0 (Backbone) connects to Area 1 via an ABR (Area Border Router)
✅ Efficient routing between 192.168.10.0, 192.168.20.0, and 192.168.30.0
✅ OSPF adjacency established between routers for optimized path selection

Configuration Summary:
🔹 Assigned IP addresses to router interfaces
🔹 Configured OSPF with multiple areas
🔹 Verified connectivity using show ip route and ping

This setup ensures optimized routing, reduced overhead, and better network segmentation. 🚀
